# Social Media API Proxy Progress

## Project Status: Ready for v1 Release

The project has successfully implemented a platform-agnostic architecture that makes it easier to
adapt the service for other social media platforms beyond Twitter. All core functionality is
complete, tested, and documented.

## Completed Features

### Core Infrastructure

- ✅ Deno project setup with TypeScript configuration
- ✅ Routing system with Hono
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ CORS handling middleware
- ✅ Authentication middleware
- ✅ Validation middleware with Zod schemas
- ✅ Dependency injection throughout the codebase

### Authentication

- ✅ Platform-specific authentication routes
- ✅ OAuth initialization endpoint
- ✅ OAuth callback handler
- ✅ Token storage service with Deno KV
- ✅ Token refresh mechanism
- ✅ Token revocation endpoint
- ✅ NEAR wallet signature authentication
- ✅ Versioned encryption for token storage
- ✅ Token access logging with PII redaction

### Platform Abstraction

- ✅ Platform abstraction interfaces
- ✅ Twitter-specific implementations
- ✅ Base platform classes with common functionality
- ✅ Platform error handling with standardized error types
- ✅ KV utility classes for standardized KV operations

### Post Operations

- ✅ Post creation endpoint
- ✅ Repost functionality
- ✅ Quote post functionality
- ✅ Post deletion endpoint
- ✅ Like/unlike functionality
- ✅ Reply functionality
- ✅ Thread support

### Media Handling

- ✅ Media upload endpoint
- ✅ Chunked upload support
- ✅ Media status endpoint
- ✅ Media attachment to posts

### SDK

- ✅ SDK architecture design
- ✅ Shared type definitions package (@crosspost/types)
- ✅ Main API client package (@crosspost/sdk)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation for all packages

### Types and Schemas

- ✅ Centralized schema and type definitions
- ✅ TypeScript types derived from Zod schemas
- ✅ Organization by domain rather than by request/response
- ✅ Enhanced response types for standardized responses

### Error Handling

- ✅ Comprehensive error handling strategy
- ✅ Standardized error codes with ApiErrorCode enum
- ✅ Consistent HTTP status code mapping
- ✅ Enhanced error detail creation
- ✅ Proper error propagation across the system

### Testing

- ✅ Comprehensive testing strategy
- ✅ Mock implementations for external dependencies
- ✅ Controller tests with edge case coverage
- ✅ Authentication flow tests
- ✅ Post operation tests
- ✅ Error handling tests

  - ✅ Error information extraction utilities
  - ✅ Error context enrichment
  - ✅ API wrapper for consistent error handling
- 🔄 Flexible authentication strategies (Direct and Cookie-based)
  - ✅ Direct authentication via constructor
  - ✅ Cookie-based authentication implementation
  - ✅ `setAuthentication` method for explicit auth setting
- ✅ CSRF protection support
  - ✅ CSRF token reading from cookie
  - ✅ CSRF token header inclusion for state-changing requests
  - ✅ Backend middleware implementation with signed cookies
- 🔄 Persistent authentication via secure cookies
  - ✅ Secure cookie settings (`SameSite=Lax`, `Secure`, `Path=/`)
  - ✅ Cookie expiration (30 days)
  - ⬜ HttpOnly implementation review
- ⬜ Additional platform-specific clients
- ⬜ More comprehensive examples
- ⬜ React/Vue/Angular integration examples

## Known Considerations

1. Deno KV is still in beta/unstable status but has proven reliable for our use case
2. Rate limit data is not persisted across worker restarts
3. Some platforms may have API changes that require updates to our implementations
4. Large media uploads may require optimization for better performance
